# Development
Here you will find all the different scripts and tools that we use to generate [the data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data).

As there are several metrics being reported, each with its independent pipeline, the overall data pipeline can seem a bit
complex. Therefore, tis file attempts to explain the most relevant processes in use as we believe that transparency
is a must and that it can help developers in contributing to the project.

|Folder|Description                  |
|------|-----------------------------|
|[`grapher`](grapher)|Contains output files that power our [_grapher_](https://ourworldindata.org/owid-grapher) visualizations|
|[`input`](input)|External files used to compute derived metrics, such as X-per capita, and aggregate groups, such as 'Asia', etc.|
|[`notebook`](notebooks)|Notebooks used for test purposes.|
|[`scripts`](scripts)|Contains all pipelines. The code is a mixture of R and Python scripts.|

Note that the folder [public/data](../public/data) is not to be modified, as it contains output files generated by this
pipeline. Exceptions may include output folder refactor and others.

## Vaccination data
> 📁 Find it at [`scripts/vaccinations/`](scripts/vaccinations)

It is pobably the most mature and complex process. It includes a python library that provides all the tools to run all
country importers.

   - [Vaccination data overview](scripts/vaccinations/README.md)
   - [Vaccination data contribution guideline](scripts/vaccinations/CONTRIBUTE.md)

## Test data
> 📁 Find it at [`scripts/testing/`](scripts/testing)

It resembles very much the architecture of the vaccination pipeline, but differs in some key points. The most noticeable
difference is that it contains both R and python code. We currently prefer contributions in Python.

## Excess Mortality data
> 📁 Find it at [`scripts/excessmortality.py`](scripts/excessmortality.py)

Collects excess [mortality data](https://github.com/owid/owid-datasets/tree/master/datasets/Excess%20Mortality%20Data%20%E2%80%93%20OWID%20(2021))
and exports it to human-readable format.
